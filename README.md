# Bookstore_Sales_and_Customer_Analysis_Report
SQL-Based Bookstore Data Analysis Project  

**Project Overview**  
This project focuses on analyzing **bookstore data** using **SQL queries**. The dataset includes detailed information about **books, customers, and orders**. The goal of this analysis was to answer key business questions such as **revenue generation, customer behavior, stock management**, and **book sales performance** across genres and authors.  

The project involved querying data from multiple CSV files, performing aggregations, and joining tables to extract insights. The analysis also explored order trends, customer spending habits, and genre popularity.  

 **Key Insights and Analysis Performed**  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Books Analysis**  
 Retrieved all books from specific genres (e.g., **Fiction**, **Fantasy**).  
 Identified the **most expensive** and **lowest stock** books.  
 Calculated the **average price** of books in different genres.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Customer Analysis**  
 Listed customers by country (e.g., customers from **Canada**).  
 Identified customers who **placed multiple orders** or **spent the most** on orders.  
 Analyzed customer distribution by **city** for high spenders.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Orders and Revenue Analysis**  
 Analyzed orders by **date** (e.g., orders placed in **November 2023**).  
 Calculated **total revenue** from all orders.  
 Found the **most frequently ordered books**.  
 Calculated the **total quantity of books sold** per genre and author.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Inventory and Stock Management**  
 Computed the **total stock** available.  
 Calculated **remaining stock** after fulfilling all orders.  

 üìÇ **Project Files**  
 **Books.csv** ‚Äì Dataset containing book details.  
 **Customers.csv** ‚Äì Dataset containing customer information.  
 **Orders.csv** ‚Äì Dataset containing order transactions.  
 **Project_1.sql** ‚Äì SQL script with all analysis queries.  
 **Bookstore_Data_Analysis_Report.pdf** ‚Äì üìë Contains all SQL queries and answers to the analysis questions.  

 ‚ö° **Key SQL Concepts Used**  
 **Data Filtering** using `WHERE`, `BETWEEN`.  
 **Aggregation Functions**: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`.  
 **Joins**: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN` for combining data from multiple tables.  
 **Grouping Data** using `GROUP BY` and filtering with `HAVING`.  
 **Ordering Results** using `ORDER BY` and limiting outputs with `LIMIT`.  
 **Handling Null Values** using `COALESCE()` to ensure accurate calculations.  

üéØ **Learning Outcomes**  
This project helped in:  
 Strengthening **SQL querying skills** for real-world datasets.  
 Understanding **customer purchase behavior** and **sales performance**.  
 Analyzing **inventory management** through stock and sales data.  
 Gaining practical experience in **data-driven decision-making** for retail businesses.
